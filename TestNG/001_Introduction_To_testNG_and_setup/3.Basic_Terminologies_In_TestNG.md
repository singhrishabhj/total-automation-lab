# Basic Terminologies in TestNG

Here we explains the most commonly used terms in TestNG with simple meaning and examples.

---

## 1. Test Case

A **test case** is a single unit of testing that verifies one functionality.

Example:

* Check if login works
* Verify sum of two numbers
* Validate API response

In TestNG, a test case is created using `@Test`.

---

## 2. Test Method

A **test method** is a Java method that contains the actual test logic.

Example:

```java
@Test
public void loginTest() {
    // test logic
}
```

Each `@Test` method is treated as an independent test.

---

## 3. Test Class

A **test class** contains multiple test methods.

Example:

```java
public class LoginTest {
    @Test
    public void validLogin() {}

    @Test
    public void invalidLogin() {}
}
```

---

## 4. Test Suite

A **test suite** is a collection of test classes or test methods.

In TestNG, test suites are managed using `testng.xml`.

Example:

```xml
<suite name="Smoke Suite">
    <test name="Login Tests">
        <classes>
            <class name="LoginTest"/>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
```

---

## 5. TestNG Annotations

Annotations control execution flow.

Examples:

* `@Test` – marks test method
* `@BeforeMethod` – runs before each test
* `@AfterMethod` – runs after each test
* `@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass`
* `@BeforeSuite`, `@AfterSuite`

---

## 6. Assertions

Assertions validate test results.

Example:

```java
Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected);
```

Common methods:

* `assertTrue()`
* `assertFalse()`
* `assertNull()`
* `assertNotNull()`

---

## 7. Hard Assertion vs Soft Assertion

### Hard Assertion

* Stops execution on failure
* Default behavior

### Soft Assertion

* Continues even after failure
* Errors reported at the end

---

## 8. Groups

Groups help organize tests.

Example:

```java
@Test(groups = "smoke")
```

Used to:

* Run only selected tests
* Exclude unnecessary tests

---

## 9. Priority

Controls execution order.

Example:

```java
@Test(priority = 1)
```

Lower value runs first.

---

## 10. Dependency

One test depending on another.

Example:

```java
@Test(dependsOnMethods = "loginTest")
```

Used when execution order matters.

---

## 11. Parameterization

Passing values into test methods.

Example:

```java
@Parameters("browser")
public void test(String browser) {}
```

---

## 12. Listener

Listeners listen to test events.

Example events:

* Test start
* Test pass
* Test fail
* Finish

Used for:

* Screenshot on failure
* Logs
* Report generation

---

## 13. Reporter

Displays execution logs.

Example:

```java
Reporter.log("Test Started");
```

---

## 14. Parallel Execution

Running tests simultaneously to save time.

Example:

```xml
<suite parallel="methods" thread-count="2">
```

---

## 15. Data Provider

Supplies multiple test data sets.

Example:

```java
@DataProvider(name = "data")
public Object[][] data() {}
```

---

## 16. Retry Analyzer

Automatically re-runs failed tests.

Used when tests are flaky.

---

## Final Summary

TestNG provides:

* Structure
* Automation power
* Execution control
* Real-time feedback
* CI readiness
