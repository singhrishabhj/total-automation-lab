# TestNG

# What is TestNG ?

TestNG is a **testing framework** designed to simplify a wide range of testing needs, from **unit testing** to **integration testing**.

TestNG is inspired by:

* JUnit
* NUnit

But it provides **more features** and is easier to use compared to them.

In TestNG:

> **NG stands for "Next Generation"**

## Why TestNG is Popular

TestNG is one of the **most used testing frameworks** in test automation because it:

* Is easy to learn and implement
* Supports automation testing at scale
* Integrates easily with Selenium and Maven
* Handles parallel execution and test management
* Works well with CI/CD pipelines

---

## Key Features of TestNG

* Annotation-based execution
* Parallel test execution
* Grouping and prioritization
* XML-based configuration
* Rich reporting
* Supports data-driven testing
* Easy to integrate with automation tools

---

## Where TestNG is Used

TestNG is commonly used in:

* Selenium automation projects
* API testing
* Regression and smoke testing
* Enterprise automation frameworks
* CI/CD automation pipelines

---

## Final Definition

> **TestNG is a powerful Next Generation testing framework used to design, execute, and manage automated tests efficiently.**

# TestNG – Course Content (Simplified & Expanded)

## 1. Introduction to TestNG

* What is TestNG and why it is used
* Advantages over JUnit
* Where TestNG is used in real projects
* TestNG architecture overview

---

## 2. TestNG Installation & Setup

* Installing TestNG in IntelliJ / Eclipse
* Adding TestNG dependency using Maven
* Running your first TestNG test
* Common setup issues and fixes

---

## 3. TestNG Annotations

Core annotations and how they work:

* `@Test`
* `@BeforeMethod`, `@AfterMethod`
* `@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass`
* `@BeforeSuite`, `@AfterSuite`

Understanding execution flow and order of annotations.

---

## 4. testNG.xml Configuration

Create and manage test suites:

* Running specific classes or packages
* Enabling/disabling tests
* Parallel execution
* Including / excluding methods
* Group execution via XML

---

## 5. TestNG Assertions

Verify test results using assertions:

* `assertEquals`
* `assertTrue`
* `assertFalse`
* `assertNull`
* `assertNotNull`

Difference between:

* Hard assertion
* Soft assertion

---

## 6. Prioritizing & Grouping Tests

Control execution of tests:

* `priority`
* `dependsOnMethods`
* `groups`
* Run selected groups only
* Skip groups when required

---

## 7. Parameterizing Tests

Run same test with different data:

* Using `@Parameters`
* Parameter values from `testng.xml`
* Passing values at runtime

---

## 8. TestNG Listeners

Listen to test events and generate reports:

* `onTestStart`
* `onTestSuccess`
* `onTestFailure`
* `onFinish`

Use cases:

* Screenshots on failure
* Custom logging
* Reports generation

---

## 9. Using TestNG with Automation

Integrating TestNG with:

* Selenium
* API testing
* CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

Create:

* Test suites
* Regression tests
* Smoke test flows

---

## 10. Advanced TestNG Concepts

(Optional but important)

* Parallel execution
* Retry failed tests
* Data-driven testing
* Custom listeners
* Dependency management
* Execution at suite, class & method level

---

## 11. TestNG Best Practices

Ways to write better TestNG tests:

* Keep tests independent
* Use meaningful test names
* Maintain reusable methods
* Use grouping for large projects
* Avoid hardcoding test data
* Organize test packages properly

---

## Outcome of This Course

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Write automation test cases using TestNG
* Design test suites with `testng.xml`
* Handle assertions & failures
* Manage large automation projects
* Integrate TestNG with Maven & Selenium
* Run tests in CI pipelines
